[{{ config.author }}][1] will develop a universal digital platform to support the certification of Student practice competencies during the training. Every student has an Ongoing Record of the Achievement of Practice Competence (ORAPC) document which records the required competencies each student needs to achieve, and the current state of their progress towards them. The goal of this project is to create a digital system accessible on mobile devices or through any web browser which allows Students, Mentors, and other users to efficiently understand and certify which competencies have been achieved by each student. 

Each placement will include three touch point meetings between students, mentors and tutors. The student will also have additional one-to-one meetings with their tutor. During these meetings the platform will provide an intuitive overview of the student’s progress for all parties. The school of health care sciences will also have access to an overview of all student’s progress.
	 	 	 	
Each student, according to their degree programme, has a number of practice competencies which must be demonstrated during their two 11 week long clinical placements. Each competency is composed of one or more 'Learning Outcomes'. 

Each Learning Outcome has between 1 and 3 levels of proof which need to be fulfilled to satisfy a mentor that the student has achieved the outcome. To date, the process has required students to obtain validation with in-person signatures from mentors and academic staff.
