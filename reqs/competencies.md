# Competencies

For each degree course, students have a number of competencies which they must demonstrate. Some are ‘Generic competencies’ common to all degrees, and others are ‘field specific competencies’ and therefore specific to individual degree programmes. 

Each competency is made up of a description and one or more 'Practice Learning Outcomes' which must be achieved to fulfil a given competency.
