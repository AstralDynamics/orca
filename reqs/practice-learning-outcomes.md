# Practice Learning Outcomes

Each learning outcome, has 1 to 3 levels of certification which must be provided by mentor before a student can achieve an outcome. Students must achieve all learning outcomes for each competency. 

The levels relate to how the mentor's satisfaction that the student has achieved a learning outcome. The requirements are fixed for each learning outcome and may be any combination of the following: 

1. Direct observation and questioning
2. Feedback from others, including client / service users as appropriate
3. Client/service user documentation

When at a review point, if the mentor feels the student has made ‘partial’ progress towards achieving a learning outcome. The mentor may add a progress point which is a dated note, and is a communication to the student and other staff about what the student has achieved to date.
