# Background

Before a student can become a registered medical practitioner, they must demonstrate competence in a range of areas. To validate this competency, they must complete an Ongoing Record of Achievement of Practice Competence (ORAPC).

The ORAPC details all of the practice competencies that the student must exhibit and each competency is verified by an assigned mentor whilst the student is on placement.
