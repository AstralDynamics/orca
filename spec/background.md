# Background

Before a student can become a registered medical practitioner, they must demonstrate competence in a range of areas. To validate this competency, they must complete an Ongoing Record of Achievement of Practice Competence (ORAPC).

The ORAPC details all of the practice competencies that the student must exhibit and each competency is verified by an assigned mentor whilst the student is on placement.

Each placement will include three touch point meetings between students, mentors and tutors. The student will also have additional one-to-one meetings with their tutor. During these meetings the platform will provide an intuitive overview of the student's progress for all parties. The school of health care sciences will also have access to an overview of all student's progress.

Each student, according to their degree programme, has a number of practice competencies which must be demonstrated during their two 11 week long clinical placements. Each competency is composed of one or more 'Learning Outcomes'. 

Each Learning Outcome has between one and three levels of proof which need to be fulfilled to satisfy a mentor that the student has achieved the outcome. To date, the process has also required students to obtain validation with in-person signatures from mentors and academic staff.
