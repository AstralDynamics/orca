# Deliverables

Before development on the final platform can be started, the following pre-requisite deliverables must be completed.

| Component | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Branding & Designs | The Supplier will iteratively source a high quality brand and accompanying set of graphic designs that will help all involved parties know what to expect from the user interfaces in the completed platform. |
| Prototype | The Supplier will use the branding and graphic designs to put together a prototype that will demonstrate the functionality to the client. |
| Iterated Designs & Specs | The Supplier will work with the client to revise the designs and specifications to account for feedback based on the prototype. |
| Technical Specification | The Supplier will author a technical specification which will unambiguously document the technical requirements, constraints, decisions and plans for the project. |

Once the prerequisites have been delivered, the client and the Supplier will have the necessary guarantees in place to start development on the final platform.
