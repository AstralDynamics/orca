| Component | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| User Interface Designs | The Supplier will source a high quality brand and accompanying set of graphic designs that will help all involved parties know what to expect from the user interfaces in the completed platform. |
| Prototype | The Supplier will use the branding and graphic designs to build a functioning prototype application that will demonstrate the functionality to the client. |
| Iterated Designs & Specs | The Supplier will work with the client to revise the designs and specifications to account for feedback based on the prototype. |
| Technical Specification | The Supplier will author a technical specification which will unambiguously document the technical requirements, constraints, decisions and plans for the phase 2 project. |
