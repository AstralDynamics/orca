# Branding & Design

The Supplier will work with the client and a graphic designer to identify a name and brand for the platform. The client will have continuous input into a short cycle of designs, previews and iterations.

Once the client has identified an appropriate "look & feel", the Supplier will work with the designer to translate the existing wireframes into responsive vector graphic designs that show how the platform will look.
