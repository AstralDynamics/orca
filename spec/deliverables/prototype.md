# Prototype

The Supplier will use the graphic designs to build a prototype version of the platform that the client can test with users.

This deliverable is made up of the following sub-components.

| Component | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| User Interfaces | The Supplier will create the code for each mobile user interface provided by the graphic designer. |
| Database | The Supplier will setup and populate the prototype database. |
| Backend | The Supplier will write the code that gets data from the database and sends it to the client devices. |
| Frontend | The Supplier will write the code that puts that data into the user interfaces. |

## Limitations
 
The prototype will have the following limitations.

### Manual Model Management
For the prototype, the client will not be able to create new users, competencies or learning outcomes independently. These feature are needed for long term development of the platform and will be commissioned in phase 1. During Phase 1 the supplier will be responsible to for configuring the platform with data such that it can be fully tested by the client.

### Authentication
The prototype will not feature a complete authentication system with password management features. Each user of the system during testing will be provided with a unique URL which will allow them to access the system.  

### Responsive Design
The prototype will not be designed to work at multiple resolutions. However, it will be designed to work on mobile devices, and will be able to be viewed on larger screens too.

### Browser Support
The prototype will only be designed to work with the latest version of Google Chrome. Performance of the applications in other browsers may vary. The prototype will enable testing on other browsers in order to inform Phase 2. 

### Component Reuse
The Supplier will build the prototype as a web application, using a modern JavaScript framework like React or Cycle.js so that components may be re-used in the final build for the platform.

### Integration
The prototype will not integrate with any external systems.

### Hosting
The prototype will be hosted in the cloud by the supplier.
