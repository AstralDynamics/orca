# Prototype

The Supplier will use the graphic designs to build a prototype version of the platform that the client can try and test.

This deliverable is made up of the following sub-components.

| Component | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| User Interfaces | The Supplier will create the code for each mobile user interface provided by the graphic designer. |
| Database | The Supplier will setup and populate the prototype database. |
| Backend | The Supplier will write the code that gets data from the database and sends it to the client devices. |
| Frontend | The Supplier will write the code that puts that data into the user interfaces. |

## Limitations
 
The prototype will have the following limitations.

### Manual Model Management
To save time, the Supplier will manage the models manually in the database, rather than building an interface for an administrator type role. This will mean that for the prototype, the client will not be able to create new users, competencies or learning outcomes.

### Authentication
The prototype will not feature any authentication system. This will include any email and notification support that may be included as part of the final platform technical specification.

### Responsive Design
The prototype will not be designed to work at multiple resolutions. However, it will be designed to work on mobile devices, meaning that it could be viewed on larger screens too.

### Browser Support
The prototype will only be designed to work with the latest version of Google Chrome. This will save the Supplier considerable time, allowing them to focus on implementing the core features of the user experience.

### Component Reuse
The Supplier will build the prototype as a web application, using a modern JavaScript framework like React or Cycle.js so that components may be re-used in the final build for the platform.

### Integration
The prototype will not integrate with any university systems.
