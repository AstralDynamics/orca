# Technical Specification

Once the functional specification and graphic designs have been revised, the Supplier will author a technical specification.

The technical specification will provide a clear technical reference for the developers who will be building the platform. It will identify the technologies to be used, but also the high level architectures, device specifications and data modelling references.

The technical specification will allow the Supplier to work with a more flexible team of developers who are all working to the exact same technical guidelines for developing the platform. This cohesion will ensure that the work is accomplished efficiently and correctly.

The client will be provided with a copy of the technical specification, which will allow them to support the platform going forwards, to use as a reference if they decide to work with other development teams or choose to integrate the platform with another internal university system.

This deliverable is made up of exactly one component.
