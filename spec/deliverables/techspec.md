# Technical Specification

Once the functional specification and graphic designs have been revised, the Supplier will author a technical specification.

The technical specification will provide a clear technical reference for the developers who will be building the platform in Phase 2. It will identify the technologies to be used, the high level architectures, device specifications and data modelling references.

The technical specification will allow the Supplier to work with a flexible team of developers working to the exact technical guidelines for developing the platform. This cohesion will ensure that the work is accomplished efficiently and correctly.

The client will be provided with a copy of the technical specification, which will allow the client to support the platform going forwards, should the client wish to develop the platform in future independently of the Phase 1 supplier. 

This deliverable is made up of exactly one component.
