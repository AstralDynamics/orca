# Development

The Supplier will use real-time chat and issue tracking facilities to create an interactive development experience for the client.

## Chat
The Supplier will provide a real-time chat room that the client can use to engage in realtime discussion with developers throughout the week. The room will be integrated with an issue tracker, so the client will be notified when the Supplier is making progress with the identified features.

## Issue Tracking
The Supplier will also provide an issue tracking board, which the client can use to submit proposals for features, or describe any bugs they might encounter whilst using the platform.

### Features
To request a feature or a change in the platform, the client will access The Supplier's "Features" board and create a card in the "Proposals" queue.

Each proposal card must have:
* A descriptive title for the feature/change.
* A longer description
* __Exactly one__ assigned user (representing the client) to track the progress.

After the client submits a proposal for a feature The Supplier will assess the complexity of the feature, then decide whether it can be implemented as part of the contract, or whether it needs to become part of a future contract instead.

If The Supplier accepts the proposal, then the client will be able to use the issue tracker to track the development progress for that feature.

### Bugs
To track a bug, the client will access The Supplier's "Bugs" issue tracking board and create a card in the "Known Bugs" queue.

Each bug card must have:
* A descriptive title for the feature/change.
* A longer description
* __Exactly one__ assigned user (representing the client) to track the progress.

Once The Supplier identifies the cause of the bug, the card will be moved into the "Known Fixes" queue. From here, the client will be able to use the issue tracker to track progress on the bugs.

## Development Preview
The Supplier will manage a rolling release development preview which will be updated at the end of every week. The client will be able to use this version of the platform to monitor the development progress.

## Final Deliverable
When development finishes, The Supplier will deliver the code along with the appropriate technical documentation so that the client has control of how and where the platform is deployed.

The Supplier will deliver a web application that works in the most recent version of the following modern browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Internet Explorer) on both mobile, tablet and desktop devices.

The Supplier will not actively test the application in old versions of browsers, but bugs reported through the issue tracker will be addressed appropriately.
