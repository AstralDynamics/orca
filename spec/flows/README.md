# Flows

The following flow diagrams are mappings of the processes in the previous section.

The Supplier will use these diagrams to design the user experiences for each type of user. During testing they will be used to validate that the platform is both complete and works as specified.


In each case it's expected that when the flow reaches an end state, the user in question would be able to return to the beginning of the application again.
