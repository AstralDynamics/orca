# Flows

The following flow diagrams are literal translations of the activities described in the previous section.

Astral Dynamics will use these diagrams to design the user experiences for each type of user and eventually our testers will use them to validate that the platform is both complete and works as specified.

In each case it's expected that when the flow reaches an end state, the user in question would be able to return to the beginning of the application again.
