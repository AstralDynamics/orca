Upon opening the application, the student will see their list of competencies. They will be able to easily distinguish between competencies they have already completed, competencies that are currently in progress, and competencies they have not yet started.

This flow also details the continuation after a student marks a competency for mentor review. This flow continues to the point at which the student either receives a partial progress note, or a mentor certification.

It's also important to note that this process will be asynchronous. The student won't have to wait for a mentor response before they start tracking another competency. For example, after marking for mentor review, the student could return to the initial state of this flow.
