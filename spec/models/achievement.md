# Achievement

An achievement represents a competency in its most generic form. An achievement has a title, description and a list of checkpoints that must completed to complete the achievement.

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Title | The name of the achievement in question |
| Overview | A short overview of the achievement |
| Checkpoints | A list of progress points |

## Guidelines
* The title field should be a short but descriptive name that helps students uniquely identify a given achievement.

* The overview should be a single paragraph that expands on the title to provide a clear description of the purpose of the achievement.

* The checkpoints should be a short (<5 items) list, in which each item describes a given checkpoint that the student must accomplish to demonstrate a competency.

## Examples

| Title | Overview | Checkpoints |
