# Development

Astral Dynamics will use [Slack][2] and [Trello][1] to create an interactive development experience for the clients.

## Slack
Astral Dynamics will provide a Slack room that the client can use to engage in realtime discussion with us throughout the week. The slack room will be integrated with our issue tracker, so you'll be able to see us making progress with the identified features.

## Trello
Astral Dynamics will also provide a Trello board, which the client can use to submit proposals for features, or describe any bugs they might encounter whilst using the platform.

### Features
To request a feature or a change in the platform, the client will access Astral Dynamics' "Features" Trello board and create a card in the "Proposals" queue.

Each proposal card must have:
* A descriptive title for the feature/change.
* A longer description
* __Exactly one__ assigned user (representing the client) to track the progress.

After the client submits a proposal for a feature Astral Dynamics will assess the complexity of the feature, then decide whether it can be implemented as part of the contract, or whether it needs to become part of a future contract instead.

If Astral Dynamics accepts the proposal, then the client will be able to use Trello to track the development progress for that feature.

### Bugs
To track a bug, the client will access Astral Dynamics' "Bugs" Trello board and create a card in the "Known Bugs" queue.

Each bug card must have:
* A descriptive title for the feature/change.
* A longer description
* __Exactly one__ assigned user (representing the client) to track the progress.

Once Astral Dynamics identifies the cause of the bug, the card will be moved into the "Known Fixes" queue. From here, the client will be able to use Trello to track progress on the bugs.

## Development Preview
Astral Dynamics will manage a rolling release development preview which will be updated at the end of every week. The client will be able to use this version of the platform to monitor the development progress.

## Deployment
Long term deployment of this platform is out of scope for this specification as it's not yet clear who will maintain the platform going forwards.

Deployment will be revisited when we iterate on the specifications after completing work on the prototype.

## Final Deliverable
When development finishes, Astral Dynamics will deliver the code along with the appropriate technical documentation so that the client has control of how and where the platform is deployed.

Astral Dynamics will deliver a web application that works in the most recent version of the following modern browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Internet Explorer) on both mobile, tablet and desktop devices.

Astral Dynamics will not actively test the application in old versions of browsers, but bugs reported through the Trello board will be addressed appropriately.
