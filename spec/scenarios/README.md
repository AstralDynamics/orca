# Scenarios

Before a student can become a registered medical practitioner, they must demonstrate competence in a range of areas. To validate this competency, they must complete an Ongoing Record of Achievement of Practice Competence (ORAPC).

The ORAPC details all of the practice competencies that the student  _must_ exhibit and each competency is verified by an assigned mentor whilst the student is on placement.

Students, mentors and personal tutors will interface with the platform through a mobile or desktop device to help them understand and certify which competencies have been achieved.

The following scenarios detail the stereotypical ways in which the platform would be used by the various types of user.
