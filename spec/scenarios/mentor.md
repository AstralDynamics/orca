## Scenario 2: Mentor

This scenario is designed to help understand a typical workflow for a mentor using the platform.

1. A mentor is assigned to a new group of students and they use the platform to review the ORAPC for each student.

* They are notified to let them know that a student has marked a learning outcome for mentor review.

* They decide that the student has made some progress, but not enough to certify the learning outcome in question, so they mark the learning outcome as "partial progress".

* Later that week the student again notifies the mentor by marking the same learning outcome for mentor review.

* The mentor has observed progress since the last mentor review and they decide to certify the learning outcome.

* At the end of each week the mentor meets with their student and tutor for a touch point meeting. All parties can use the platform to review the student's progress.
