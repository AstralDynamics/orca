## Scenario 2: Mentor

This scenario is illustrates a typical workflow for a mentor using the platform.

1. A mentor is assigned to a new students or group of students and they use the platform to review the ORAPC for each student.

* They are notified to let them know that a student has marked a learning outcome for mentor review.

* They decide that the student has made some progress, but not enough to certify the learning outcome in question, so they mark the learning outcome as "partial progress". They are able to leave a short progress point note.

* The Student revisits the learning outcome. Later in the placement the mentor is again notified the student has marked the same learning outcome for mentor review.

* The mentor has observed progress since the last mentor review and they decide to certify the learning outcome.
