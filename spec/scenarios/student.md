## Scenario 1: Student

This scenario is designed to help understand a typical workflow for a student using the platform.

1. At the beginning of a year the student views their ORAPC to read and understand the list of competencies they are expected to attain.

* During their clinical placement, the student believes they have achieved a specific learning outcome, so they select it from a list and mark it for mentor review.

* The student sees that learning outcome enter the "pending" state.

* Eventually the learning outcome switches from "pending" to the "partial progress" state. The student knows the mentor does not think they have achieved the outcome so they continue to work towards it.

* The student again feels they have achieved the learning outcome, so again they mark it for mentor review and it re-enters the "pending" state.

* This time, the learning outcome is certified and it switches to the "certified" state.

* At the end of each week the student meets with their mentors and tutor for a touch point meeting. All parties can use the platform to review the student's progress.
