# Screens
This section will detail the major screens required for the user interfaces that will be required to implement the user flows from the previous section.

## Wireframes
All graphics are provided in the form of wireframes. These graphics do not represent the intended style for the interfaces, but rather they help us understand which elements need to be present on each screen and give all parties an idea of how they _could_ be layed out.

At the appropriate stage, Astral Dynamics will work with a graphic designer to turn these wireframes into branded, vector graphics. For each identified user interface, Astral Dynamics will also show the ways they would look on mobiles, tablets and desktop/laptop screens.
