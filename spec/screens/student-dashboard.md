# Student Dashboard

The student dashboard is the home screen that the student will return to in order to check the state of their Learning Outcomes across the various competencies.

Above is a wireframe which describes the required elements for the student's home screen or _dashboard_.

## Competency List
The primary focus is the list of competencies that occupy the main part of the screen. Each one is composed of three main components.

### Compentecy Title
Each competency has a clear title, which the student can search against.

### Learning Outcome Title
Each competency has one or more Learning Outcomes associated with it, each of which has a title. 

### State Indicator
A progress indicator for each competency shows the overall state of progress made by the student towards achieving the competency, factoring in how many of the individual Learning Outcomes have been achieved.

### Expanded Overview
A competency can be expanded to show the descripion text as well as the individual learning outcomes, their descriptions and an interface which shows the current state of each of the required demostration levels for the Learning Outcome.

A student user can tap or click on one of these levels to mark it for mentor review. The interface will make it clear which levels have been so marked and allow the user to cancel if they accidentally mark the incorrect Learning Outcome level. When a mentor marks it as complete it will change again.

## Search
A portion of the screen will be reserved for allowing the student to run a text based search for a given competency. This will reduce the list of competencies shown on screen based on the search criteria.

## Filtering
The bottom of the screens shows filtering controls that will allow a student to see the competencies from a specific year. This will provide them with insight as to what's still to come from future placements. It will also allow second and third year students to look back at their previous placements.
